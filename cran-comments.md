Dear CRAN maintainers,

This release fixes a bug created by the most recent phytools release.  This now fixes the warnings regarding importing the necessary functions from the previously-considered 'base' packages, and fixes a failing test introduced by an over-zealous .Rbuildignore line (apologies for the previous oversight).  

Cheers,

Carl
